The primary objective of this project is to reproduce an experiment conducted in a [published article](https://aclanthology.org/2020.wmt-1.132.pdf) from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) to ensure the correct implementation of the model on German-Czech and German-Upper Sorbian language pairs, apply the same model to a different dataset and check whether achieving comparable results on different language pairs is possible, namely Russian-Chuvash and Russian-Khakas.

So the repository contains two folders with thorough description of the processes of building the vocabularies, preparing the data, training the models and evaluating the results.

Future work may include translating to opposite direction and applying other training methods.
